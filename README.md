# cryptopals_in_c
My attempts at the Cryptopals challengs written in C

I attempted this in C, because I was frustrated with Python3 and how it uses UTF-8 encoding by default. Doing this in C and juggling unsigned chars was a lot more bare metal. I actually really enjoyed doing the first part in C.
